Since you have provided an empty "Current Code" section and only a patch, I cannot generate a complete and correct code for you. The patch indicates a change in an import statement from `user.entity` to `users.entity`, but without the original code, I cannot apply this patch.

To apply a patch like the one you've provided, I would need the original source code that the patch is meant to modify. If you can provide the original code from the `user.service.ts` file, I can then apply the patch and give you the updated complete code. Please provide the original code, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
