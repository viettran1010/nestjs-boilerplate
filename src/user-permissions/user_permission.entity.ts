It appears there is a misunderstanding. The information provided does not include any actual code to be patched. The "patch" you've provided is a Git diff output indicating a file rename operation, not changes within the contents of a file. Without the original source code from the file `user_permission.entity.ts`, it is impossible to provide you with the "complete and correct code."

If you have the original source code from `user_permission.entity.ts`, please provide it, and I can then apply any patch you have to that code. Otherwise, there is no code to display or modify based on the information given.
