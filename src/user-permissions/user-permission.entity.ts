The information provided does not include the actual code content from the file `user_permission.entity.ts`. The patch indicates a file rename operation from `src/user_permissions/user_permission.entity.ts` to `src/user-permissions/user-permission.entity.ts`, but without the original file content, it is not possible to provide the complete and correct code.

To apply the patch and provide the complete code, the original content of the file `user_permission.entity.ts` is required. If you can provide the content of this file, I can then apply the patch and give you the complete code after the rename operation. Without the original code, I cannot fulfill your request. Please provide the content of the file, and I will be happy to assist you further.
