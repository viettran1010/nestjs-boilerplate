It appears there is a misunderstanding. The "Current Code" section you've provided is empty, and the "Patch" section only contains a Git diff command indicating a file rename without any changes to the actual code content. Since there is no code provided to patch or modify, I cannot generate a complete and correct code for you.

If you have the actual code that needs to be patched, please provide it, and I can apply the patch accordingly. Otherwise, with the information given, there is no code to respond with.
