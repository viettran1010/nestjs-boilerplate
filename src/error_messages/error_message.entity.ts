It appears there is a misunderstanding. The information provided does not include the actual code from the file `error-message.entity.ts`. The patch information only indicates that the file has been renamed from `src/error-messages/error-message.entity.ts` to `src/error_messages/error_message.entity.ts`. Without the original code content of the file, it is impossible to provide the complete and correct code as requested.

To assist you properly, please provide the original code from the file `error-message.entity.ts`, and I will be able to apply the patch and provide the complete code as per your request.
