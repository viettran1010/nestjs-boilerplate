The provided "Current Code" section is empty, and the "Patch" section indicates a file rename operation rather than changes to the code itself. Since there is no actual code content to apply the patch to, and the patch only renames the file from `app.controller.spec.ts.ts` to `app.controller.spec.ts`, there is no code to provide.

If you have an actual code snippet that needs to be patched, please provide the code, and I can apply the patch to it. Otherwise, based on the information given, there is no code to display as the expected response.
