The provided patch indicates that there is a file rename operation from `src/app.controller.spec.ts.ts` to `src/app.controller.spec.ts`. However, there is no actual code content provided in the "Current Code" section to apply the patch to or to display as the complete code.

Given the instructions and the patch content, the expected response format would be an empty TypeScript file named `src/app.controller.spec.ts`, as no code content is provided to include within the file. Since there is no code to show, the response would be:

```

``` 

This represents an empty TypeScript file, which is the result of renaming the file as per the patch instructions, but without any code content to display.
