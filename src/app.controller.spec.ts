The provided patch indicates that there is a file rename operation but does not include any changes to the code itself. The patch suggests that the file `app.controller.spec.ts.ts` should be renamed to `app.controller.spec.ts`. Since there is no actual code content provided in the "Current Code" section, and the patch does not include code changes, there is no code to present.

If you have the current code that needs to be patched, please provide it, and I can apply the patch to show the complete and correct code. Without the current code, I cannot generate the expected response.
