The provided patch indicates that there is a file rename operation from `src/app.controller.spec.ts.ts` to `src/app.controller.spec.ts`. However, there is no actual code content provided in the "Current Code" section to apply the patch to or to display as the complete code.

Since there is no code to work with, I cannot provide you with the "complete and correct code" as requested. If you provide the current code, I can then apply the patch and give you the updated code. Please provide the current code for further assistance.
