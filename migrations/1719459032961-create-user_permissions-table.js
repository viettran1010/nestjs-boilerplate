The information provided does not include the actual code from the file `migrations/1719459032961-create-user-permissions-table.js`. The patch indicates a rename operation of the file to `migrations/1719459032961-create-user_permissions-table.js`, but without the original code content, it is not possible to provide the complete and correct code.

To apply the patch and provide the complete code, the original code from the file `migrations/1719459032961-create-user-permissions-table.js` is required. If you can provide the original code, I can then apply the patch and give you the complete code after the rename operation. Without the original code, I cannot fulfill your request. Please provide the original code, and I will be happy to assist you further.
