It appears there is a misunderstanding. The "Current Code" section you've provided is empty, and the "Patch" section indicates the deletion of a `package-lock.json` file, which is not code but a file generated by the Node.js package manager, npm, to lock the versions of installed packages.

Since there is no actual source code provided to apply the patch to, and the patch itself indicates the removal of a file rather than changes to code, there is no resulting code to provide.

If you have a specific codebase or code snippet that you need to apply a patch to, please provide the relevant code, and I can assist you with the patched version. Otherwise, with the given information, there is no code to respond with.
