It appears there is a misunderstanding. The "Current Code" section you've provided is empty, and the "Patch" section indicates the deletion of a `package-lock.json` file, which is not source code but a file generated by the Node.js package manager, npm, to lock the versions of dependencies.

Since there is no actual source code provided to apply the patch to, and the patch itself indicates the deletion of a file, there is no resulting code to provide. If you have source code that needs to be patched, please provide the code, and I can assist you with applying the patch. Otherwise, if you're looking to understand how to apply a patch to a file, you would typically use the `patch` command in a Unix-like environment, or equivalent tools in other environments.

If you need assistance with a different request or have the actual source code that needs to be patched, please provide the relevant details, and I'll be happy to help.
