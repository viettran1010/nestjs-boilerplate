It appears there is a misunderstanding. The current code block you've provided is empty, and the patch you've provided indicates the deletion of a `package-lock.json` file, which is not directly related to code but rather a file used by npm for managing package versions.

Since there is no actual code provided to apply the patch to, and the patch itself signifies the deletion of a file, there is no resulting code to present. If you have a specific code snippet or file that you need to apply a patch to, please provide the original code, and I can assist you with the patched version.

If you intended to show the deletion of `package-lock.json` as the patch, the expected response format would be an empty response, as the file is deleted and there is no code to display. However, since you've requested a complete and correct code, please provide the original code for an accurate response.
