It appears there is a misunderstanding. The "Current Code" section you've provided is empty, and the "Patch" section indicates the deletion of a `package-lock.json` file, which is not source code but a file generated by the Node.js package manager, npm, to lock the versions of a project's dependencies.

Since there is no actual source code provided to apply the patch to, and the patch itself indicates the removal of a file rather than changes to code, there is no resulting code to provide. If you have source code that needs to be patched, please provide the code, and I can assist you with applying the patch.

If you need a different kind of assistance, please provide more details or clarify your request.
