It appears there has been a misunderstanding. The "Current Code" section you've provided is empty, and the "Patch" section contains a diff for a Markdown file (README.md), not a code file. The diff suggests adding two lines to the README.md file to inform users that the project uses Yarn for package management.

Since there is no actual code provided in the "Current Code" section to apply the patch to, I cannot generate a complete and correct code for you. If you provide the original content of the README.md file or any other code files that need to be patched, I can then apply the patch and provide you with the updated content.

Please provide the necessary information, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
